# Tip-s-Calculator
This project is a simple tip calculator implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to calculate the total bill amount and the amount each person needs to pay, including the tip, based on the bill amount, service rating, and number of people sharing the bill.

## To use the tip calculator, follow these steps:
Clone the repository or download the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Alternatively, you can copy the HTML code and include it in your own project.

## Usage

The tip calculator provides a user-friendly interface with the following elements:

Bill Amount: Enter the total bill amount in the input field labeled "How much was your bill?"

Service Rating: Click on one of the buttons labeled with different percentages (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%) to select the service rating.

Number of People: Enter the number of people sharing the bill in the input field labeled "How many people sharing the bill?"

Calculate: Click the "Calculate!" button to calculate the tip and display the result.

Once the calculation is complete, a custom alert will be shown with the total bill amount for each person. Clicking the "Ok" button on the alert will reset the calculator and allow you to perform another calculation.
